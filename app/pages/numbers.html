<h2>Numbers, Symbols, and Letters</h2>
<h3>Numbers<h3>
<div>
    <p>Numbers are certainly allowed in the PL/0 machine. The digits that can only be used are zero through nine. One can definitely be able to combine them to make larger numbers; however, the absolute maximum value the machine can take is 99999.</p>
    <p>These numbers can be used in an equation, such as x := 3+2, a declarative statement x:= 5, or even to check a condition to see if it true or false (y> 3).</p>
</div>
<h3>Symbols</h3>
<div>
    <p>In the PL/0 language, there are only thirteen types of special symbols that can be used. The table below show the symbols that are used and an explanation of one of its uses in the PL/0.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Special Symbols</th><th>Explanation of its use</th></tr>
        <tr><td>+</td><td>The addition sign can either be part of a math equation.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>-</td><td>The negative symbol can be seen as the negation sign or to subtract values.</td></tr> 
        <tr><td>*</td><td>The multiplication sign can be used in a math formula.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>/</td><td>Similar like the multiplication symbol, the division sign can only be used in</td></tr> 
        <tr><td>(  )</td><td>When using the parenthesis, both sides of the parenthesis must be used. In the middle of these symbols can only lie an equation.</td></tr>  
        <tr><td>=</td><td>The equation sign can be used to check if a constant, variable, and/or number are alike.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>,</td><td>Commas are used constantly to separate more than one variable and/or constants.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>.</td><td>This symbol should only be used at the end of PL/0 language. It states that the program is done.</td></tr> 
        <tr><td>< and ></td><td>The greater-than and less-than signs are utilized when there is a condition that needs to be checked. These symbols can also be combined to make other symbols.</td></tr> 
        <tr><td>;</td><td>A semicolon is used to show that a statement or constant/variable declaration has ended (explained later in the sections).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>:</td><td>Colons are used to append before the equal sign. This sign should never be seen by itself.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>These symbols can also be combined to make other characters, such as ‘<>’, ‘<=’, ‘>=’, ‘:=’. Other symbols that are not part of the table are not considered to be symbol of the PL/0 machine (i.e. ‘$’, ‘%’, ‘^’, ‘&’, ‘!’, ‘@’, etc).</p>
</div>  
<h3>Letters</h3>
<div>
    <p>The PL/0 machine can take in any letter from ‘a’ to ‘z’ both its lower and upper case characters. The characters can be combined to make words; however, the words being generated cannot exceed eleven characters, such as the string “systemsoftware”.</p>
    <p>In addition, letters can be combined with numbers to create identifiers. An identifier is known as a sequence of characters that is used to identify to some type of program or an element. However, an identifier cannot begin with a number and it should still be 11 characters long.</p>
</div> 
<h3>Summary</h3>
<div>
    <p>The following list show examples of accepted and not acceptable for the PL/0 language.</p> 
    <table>
        <tr><th>Type</th><th>Acceptable</th><th>Not Allowed</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Numbers</td><td>45, 16, 98562</td><td>100000, 512859562</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Symbols</td><td>‘:=’, ‘;’, ‘<=‘</td><td>‘{‘, ‘]’, ‘|’, ‘?’</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Letters/Words (as well as identifers)</td><td>‘t’, “pumpkin”, “fall2014”</td><td>“autumnleaves”, “123cold”</td></tr>
