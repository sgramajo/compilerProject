<h2>Condition</h2>
<div>
    <p>Condition can be used to make sure that something is true or false before proceeding to the next part. In order to declare a Condition in the PL/0 language, there should either be an Expression or an odd first declared.</p> 
    <p>If an Expression is used first, then it needs to be followed by a relational operation and another Expression. A relational operation can either be one of these symbols: "="|“<>"|"<"|"<="|">"|">=“. These symbols stands for equal, not equal, less than, less than or equal, greater than, or greater than or equal to, respectively. By combing these components, then one can write their own Condition that compares a combination two variables/ constants.</p> 
    <p>For instances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>X > 2</li>
        <li>Y <= 4</li>
        <li>Z <> 8</li>
    </ul>
</div>
