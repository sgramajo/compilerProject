<h2>Statement</h2>	
<p>A statement is to make a declaration or make a clear expression in paper. In the similar manner, a Statement in the PL/0 language, allows one to declare different actions he/she will like the code to accomplish. A Statement grammar is where one can see the equations, variables, constants, and procedures connecting altogether.</p> 

<h3>Becomes</h3>
<div>
    <p>Recall that variables were never assigned a value when they are declared. The Become grammar in the PL/0 language allows one to map the variable to a value. Hence, a Become Statement is an identifier (that has been declared previously) that is followed by the equal sign and an Expression.</p> 
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <p style="color: green;">
    Const rice := 5, beans := 7; <br />
    var food; <br />
    procedure meal; <br /> 
    food := rice + beans; <br />
    .
    </p>
</div> 

<h3>Call</h3>
<div>
    <p>Previously, the procedure grammar was explained and how more than one procedure can be made in the PL/0 machine. At times, a function would like to access another function or itself (recursively). In order to do this, one can use the Call grammar in the PL/0 language. To do so, one only needs to write 	&#34;call&#34; and the procedure name.</p> 
    <p>For instance: </p>
    <p style="color: green">
        var f, n;<br />
        procedure fact;<br />
            var ans1;<br />
            begin<br />
                ans1:=n;<br />
                n:= n-1;<br />
                if n = 0 then f := 1;<br />
                if n > 0 then call fact;<br />
                f:=f*ans1;<br />
            end;<br />
        begin<br />
            n:=3;<br />
            call fact;<br />
            write f;<br />
        end.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Read</h3>
<div>
    <p>If there is a word that would like to be scanned into the program, then the Read grammar is used. Simply have the word &#34;read&#34; first then an identifier following it.</p>
</div> 

<h3>Write</h3>
<div>
    <p>When there is a number that one will like to print it off to the screen, the write statement is used. The write grammar only needs the word &#34;write&#34; and an identifier that has already been defined previously.</p> 
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p style="color: green;">
        var  x,y,z,v,w;<br />
        procedure a;<br />
        var x,y,u,v;<br />
        begin<br />
        x:=1; y:=2; z:=3; v:=4; w:=5;<br />
        x:=v+w;<br />
        write z;<br />
        end.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>If- then</h3>
<div>
    <p>There are times when one will like an action to be taken if a condition is met. A real life example is</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>If Suzy is cold, then she will probably wear a sweater. Although this is not PL/0 language, this example was given to better describe what an &#34;if&#34; and	&#34;then&#34; statement can do. In addition, these types of statements have an &#34;else&#34; tag after which signifies that either one condition or the other should be done. Using the same example, one can implement the if-then-else statement.</li>
        <li>If Suzy is cold- then she will probably wear a sweater – else she will buy a warm drink. Now, if one needed to implement this to the PL/0 language, note that &#34;if&#34; is followed by a Condition. When the Condition is complete, then one will have to add the &#34;then&#34; followed by the Statement with a semicolon. As mentioned before, &#34;else&#34; is not required. If it is implemented, then &#34;else&#34; will be followed by another Statement and the only semicolon that should be present in this part of the grammar should be after the else-statement.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>The following are examples using the If-then-else statement:</p> 
    <p style="color: green;">
        Const stars := 12;<br /> 
        var sky; <br />
        procedure night;<br /> 
        sky := stars + 1; <br />
        if sky > 15 then<br />
        sky := sky + 5; <br />
        .<br />
        <br />
        Const flowers := 7;<br /> 
        var meadow;<br />
        meadow := 2; <br />
        if meadow < 8 then<br />
        meadow := flowers + 4<br />
        else<br />
        meadow := flowers;<br /> 
        . 
    </p>
</div>

<h3>While – do</h3>
<div>
    <p>A while-do statement is very similar to an if-then statement; however, the while-do will allow one to continue on a loop until the condition that was first stated is no longer true. For instance, while the food is still not cooked, continue cooking it.</p> 
    <p>In this Statement, a &#34;while&#34; is first added followed by a condition, then a &#34;do&#34; and finally a Statement.</p> 
    <p>An example using while-do and implementing it to the PL/0 language.</p>
    <p style="color: green">
        Const hours := 8; <br />
        var piano, guitar, violin;<br /> 
        procedure  practice; <br />
        violin := 2; <br />
        while violin < hours do <br />
        violin := violin + 3;<br /> 
        .<br />
        Const x := 5, y := 8;<br /> 
        var w, v, z; <br />
        procedure example; <br />
        v := 2; <br />
        while v <= 5 do<br /> 
        v := v + 1; <br />
        w := y + w; <br />
        .
    </p>
<h3>Begin- End</h3>
<div>
    <p>A begin and end statement are used to write more than one statement in or out of a procedure. If one wanted to set all the variables to a certain number after declaring them, begin-end statement will let him/her do just that.</p> 
    <p>In this statement, it first starts with &#34;begin&#34; followed by a statement that can continue on following by another statement if these statements are separated with a semicolon.</p> 
    <p>An example of all of the grammar put together is as follows:</p> 
    <p style="color: green;">
        Const test = 3; /*const example */<br />
        var f, n; <br />
        procedure fact;<br />
            var ans1;<br />
            begin<br />
                ans1:=n;<br />
                n:= n-1;<br />
                if n = 0 then f := 1;<br />
                if n > 0 then call fact;<br />
                f:=f*ans1; <br />
            end;<br />
        begin<br />
            n:=3;<br />
            call fact;<br />
            write f;<br />
        end.
    </p>
    <p>Side Note: As shown above, comments can be implemented in the PL/0 language. Simply write &#34;/*&#34; followed by the comments and ending it with &#34;*/&#34;.</p>
